# VSCode Unity Learn Extension
[Unity](https://unity.com/) is one of many game engines that has taken cross-platform game development to the next level. The Unity Engine has expanded beyond the game development community and has opened doors of innovation in animation, spatial computing, cinematic arts, and graphics. 

To make the most out of Unity, it is essential and valuable for users to understand C# programming. Even when an individual’s role doesn’t require programming, a deeper understanding of C# and Visual Studio Code will support the design process. The Visual Studio Code Extension, **Unity Learn**, strives to simplify workflows to work conveniently and efficiently. The Unity Learn extension is a teaching and learning tool to help users understand and create Unity applications. This repository holds code for 1. The Unity Learn extension, which was created in Typescript and 2. A sample 3D Unity project that works in conjunction with the Unity Learn extension. 

The depth of C# programming varies drastically depending on the user’s unique needs, projects, and tasks. Therefore, the Unity Learn extension’s primary goal is not to teach mastery of the C# language but to teach how Unity and Visual Studio Code can be adapted for their purposes. 


Here are some lessons I hope students can think about while using this extension:
  * **Design and code with intention:** Unity allows developers and designers to design one application that can be built for various mobile devices, desktops, websites, consoles, and headsets. Applications that support more platforms may benefit from increased sales and profits. What other reasons led you to select those platforms for your application? How does the code or design of the application change as you customize the experience to a specific platform?
  * **Workflow:** Visual Studio and Unity work seamlessly together. However, many game developers (including me) have issues working with Visual Studio Code and Unity. Can we design a new workflow between Visual Studio Code and Unity? What could that look like?
  * **Documentation:** Documentation is your toolkit and best friend. Videos and tutorials are great. Learn how to read documentation to prototype new and custom experiences.
