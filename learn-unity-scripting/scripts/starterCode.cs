/*
Question: Player Movement
You are creating a single-player game for mobile devices, websites, and VR headsets.
Your first-person character is a GameObject on the (0,0,0) x, y, z axis in a 3D (URP) scene. 
Write a C# script using Unity’s new Input Manager System that moves the player’s 
position up, down, left, and right. The character should follow the laws of gravity
and simulate physics with RigidBody.

    // Update is called once per frame
